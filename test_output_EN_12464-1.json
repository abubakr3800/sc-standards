The illumination can be provided by daylight, artificial lighting or a combination of both.\nThe degree of visibility and comfort required in a wide range of work places is governed by the type and duration of\nactivity.\nThis standard specifies requirements for lighting systems for most indoor work places and their associated areas in\nterms of quantity and quality of illumination. In addition recommendations are given for good lighting practice.\nIt is important that all clauses of the standard are followed although the specific requirements are tabulated in the\nschedule of lighting requirements (see clause 5).\n1 Scope\nThis European Standard specifies lighting requirements for indoor work places, which meet the needs for visual\ncomfort and performance. All usual visual tasks are considered, including Display Screen Equipment (DSE).\nThis European Standard does not specify lighting requirements with respect to the safety and health of workers at\nwork and has not been prepared in the field of application of Article 137 of the EC treaty, although the lighting\nrequirements, as specified in this standard, usually fulfil safety needs. Lighting requirements with respect to the\nsafety and health of workers at work may be contained in Directives based on Article 137 of the EC treaty, in\nnational legislation of member states implementing these directives or in other national legislation of member\nstates.\nThis standard neither provides specific solutions, nor restricts the designers freedom from exploring new\ntechniques nor restricts the use of innovative equipment.\nThis standard is not applicable for the lighting of outdoor work places and underground mining.\n2 Normative references\nThis European Standard incorporates by dated or undated reference, provisions from other publications. These\nnormative references are cited at the appropriate places in the text, and the publications are listed hereafter. For\ndated references, subsequent amendments to or revisions of any of these publications apply to this European\nStandard only when incorporated in it by amendment or revision. For undated references the latest edition of the\npublication referred to applies (including amendments).\nEN 12193 Light and lighting - Sports lighting.\nEN 12665:2002 Light and lighting - Basic terms and criteria for specifying lighting\nrequirements.\nprEN 13032-1 Lighting applications - Measurement and presentation of photometric data\nof lamps and luminaires - Part 1: Measurement.\nCIE 117 1995 Discomfort glare in interior lighting.\n3 Terms and definitions\nFor the purposes of this European Standard, the terms and definitions given in EN 12665:2002 and the following\napply.\n4\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\nNOTE This clause defines terms and quantities that are in use and important to this standard, and which may not be given in\nIEC 60050-845.\n3.1\nvisual task\nvisual elements of the work being done\nNOTE The main visual elements are the size of the structure, its luminance, its contrast against the background and its\nduration.\n3.2\ntask area\npartial area in the work place in which the visual task is carried out. For places where the size and/or location of the\ntask area is unknown, the area where the task may occur shall be taken as the task area\n3.3\nimmediate surrounding area\nband with a width of at least 0,5 m surrounding the task area within the field of vision\n3.4\nmaintained illuminance (cid:1)(cid:2) )\nm\nvalue below which the average illuminance on the specified surface is not allowed to fall\nNOTE It is the average illuminance at the time maintenance should be carried out.\n3.5\nshielding angle\nangle between the horizontal plane and the first line of sight at which the luminous parts of the lamps in the\nluminaire are directly visible\n3.6\ndisplay screen equipment (DSE)\nalphanumeric or graphic display screen, regardless of the display process employed [90/270/EEC]\n3.7\nilluminance uniformity\nratio of minimum illuminance to average illuminance on a surface (see also IEC 60050-845 / CIE 17.4: 845-09-58\nUniformity ratio of illuminance)\n4 Lighting Design Criteria\n4.1 Luminous environment\nFor good lighting practice it is essential that in addition to the required illuminance, qualitative and quantitative\nneeds are satisfied.\nLighting requirements are determined by the satisfaction of three basic human needs:\n\u2014 visual comfort, where the workers have a feeling of well-being; in an indirect way also contributing to a high\nproductivity level,\n\u2014 visual performance, where the workers are able to perform their visual tasks, even under difficult circumstances\nand during longer periods,\n\u2014 safety.\nMain parameters determining the luminous environment are:\n\u2014 luminance distribution,\n\u2014 illuminance,\n5\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\n\u2014 glare,\n\u2014 directionality of light,\n\u2014 colour rendering and colour appearance of the light,\n\u2014 flicker,\n\u2014 daylight.\nValues for illuminance, discomfort glare and colour rendering are given in clause 5.\n4.2 Luminance distribution\nThe luminance distribution in the field of view controls the adaptation level of the eyes which affects task visibility.\nA well balanced adaptation luminance is needed to increase:\n\u2014 visual acuity (sharpness of vision),\n\u2014 contrast sensitivity (discrimination of small relative luminance differences),\n\u2014 efficiency of the ocular functions (such as accommodation, convergence, pupillary contraction, eye movements\netc.).\nThe luminance distribution in the field of view also affects visual comfort. The following should be avoided for the\nreasons given:\n\u2014 too high luminances which may give rise to glare,\n\u2014 too high luminance contrasts which will cause fatigue because of constant re-adaptation of the eyes,\n\u2014 too low luminances and too low luminance contrasts which result in a dull and non-stimulating working\nenvironment.\nThe luminances of all surfaces are important and will be determined by the reflectance and the illuminance on the\nsurfaces.\nRanges of useful reflectances for the major interior surfaces are:\n\u2014 ceiling: 0,6 to 0,9\n\u2014 walls: 0,3 to 0,8\n\u2014 working planes: 0,2 to 0,6\n\u2014 floor: 0,1 to 0,5\n4.3 Illuminance\nThe illuminance and its distribution on the task area and the surrounding area have a great impact on how quickly,\nsafely and comfortably a person perceives and carries out the visual task.\nAll values of illuminances specified in this standard are maintained illuminances and will provide for visual comfort\nand performance needs.\n4.3.1 Recommended illuminances at the task area\nThe values given in clause 5 are maintained illuminances over the task area on the reference surface which may\nbe horizontal, vertical or inclined. The average illuminance for each task shall not fall below the value given in\n6\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\nclause 5, regardless of the age and condition of the installation. The values are valid for normal visual conditions\nand take into account the following factors:\n\u2014 psycho-physiological aspects such as visual comfort and well-being,\n\u2014 requirements for visual tasks,\n\u2014 visual ergonomics,\n\u2014 practical experience,\n\u2014 safety,\n\u2014 economy.\nThe value of illuminance may be adjusted by at least one step in the scale of illuminances (see below), if the visual\nconditions differ from the normal assumptions.\nA factor of approximately 1,5 represents the smallest significant difference in subjective effect of illuminance. In\nnormal lighting conditions approximately 20 lx is required to just discern features of the human face and is the\nlowest value taken for the scale of illuminances. The recommended scale of illuminance (in lx) is:\n20 - 30 - 50 - 75 - 100 - 150 - 200 - 300 - 500 - 750 - 1000 - 1500 - 2000 - 3000 - 5000\nThe required maintained illuminance should be increased, when:\n\u2014 visual work is critical,\n\u2014 errors are costly to rectify,\n\u2014 accuracy or higher productivity is of great importance,\n\u2014 the visual capacity of the worker is below normal,\n\u2014 task details are of unusually small size or low contrast,\n\u2014 the task is undertaken for an unusually long time.\nThe required maintained illuminance may be decreased when:\n\u2014 task details are of an unusually large size or high contrast,\n\u2014 the task is undertaken for an unusually short time.\nIn continuously occupied areas, the maintained illuminance shall be not less than 200 lx.\n4.3.2 Illuminances of immediate surroundings\nThe illuminance of immediate surrounding areas shall be related to the illuminance of the task area and should\nprovide a well-balanced luminance distribution in the field of view.\nLarge spatial variations in illuminances around the task area may lead to visual stress and discomfort.\nThe illuminance of the immediate surrounding areas may be lower than the task illuminance but shall be not less\nthan the values given in Table 1.\n7\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\nTable 1 \u2014 Uniformities and relationship of illuminances of immediate\nsurrounding areas to task area\nTask illuminance Illuminance of immediate surrounding\nlx areas\nlx\n\u2021 750 500\n500 300\n300 200\n\u00a3 200 E task\nUniformity: \u2021 0,7 Uniformity: \u2021 0,5\nIn addition to the task illuminance the lighting shall provide adequate adaptation luminance in accordance with\nclause 4.2.\n4.3.3 Uniformity\nThe task area shall be illuminated as uniformly as possible. The uniformity of the task area and the immediate\nsurrounding areas shall be not less than the values given in Table 1.\n4.4 Glare\nGlare is the sensation produced by bright areas within the field of view and may be experienced either as\ndiscomfort glare or disability glare. Glare caused by reflections in specular surfaces is usually known as veiling\nreflections or reflected glare.\nIt is important to limit the glare to avoid errors, fatigue and accidents.\nIn interior work places, discomfort glare may arise directly from bright luminaires or windows. If discomfort glare\nlimits are met, disability glare is not usually a major problem.\nNOTE Special care is needed to avoid glare when the direction of view is above horizontal.\n4.4.1 Discomfort glare\nThe rating of discomfort glare directly from the luminaires of an indoor lighting installation shall be determined using\nthe CIE Unified Glare Rating (UGR-) tabular method, based on the formula:\nUGR=8log\n(cid:230)\n(cid:231) 0,25 (cid:229) L\n2w (cid:246)\n(cid:247)\n10 \u0141 (cid:231) L b p 2 \u0142 (cid:247)\nwhere:\nL is the background luminance in cd \u00b7 m-2, calculated as E \u00b7 p-1, in which E is the vertical indirect illuminance\nb ind ind\nat the observer's eye,\nL is the luminance of the luminous parts of each luminaire in the direction of the observer's eye in cd \u00b7 m-2,\nw is the solid angle (steradian) of the luminous parts of each luminaire at the observer's eye,\np is the Guth position index for each individual luminaire which relates to its displacement from the line of sight.\nAll assumptions made in the determination of UGR shall be stated in the scheme documentation. The UGR value\nof the lighting installation shall not exceed the value given in clause 5.\n8\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\nNOTE 1 The variations of UGR within the room may be determined using the formula (or the comprehensive table) for different\nobserver positions. Limits for this condition are under consideration.\nNOTE 2 If the maximum UGR value in the room is higher than the UGR limit given in clause 5, information on appropriate\npositions for work stations within the room may be needed.\nNOTE 3 Discomfort glare from windows is still a topic of research. There is currently no suitable glare rating method available.\n4.4.2 Shielding against glare\nBright light sources can cause glare and can impair the vision of objects. It shall be avoided for example by suitable\nshielding of lamps or shading of windows by blinds.\nThe minimum shielding angles given in Table 2 shall be applied for the specified lamp luminances.\nNOTE The values given in Table 2 do not apply to uplighters or to luminaires mounted below normal eye level.\nTable 2 \u2014 Minimum shielding angles at specified lamp luminances\nLamp luminance Minimum shielding angle\nkcd \u00b7 m-2\n20 to < 50 15\u00b0\n50 to < 500 20\u00b0\n\u2021 500 30\u00b0\n4.4.3 Veiling reflections and reflected glare\nHigh brightness reflections in the visual task may alter task visibility, usually detrimentally. Veiling reflections and\nreflected glare may be prevented or reduced by the following measures:\n\u2014 arrangement of luminaires and work places,\n\u2014 surface finish (matt surfaces),\n\u2014 luminance restriction of luminaires,\n\u2014 increased luminous area of the luminaire,\n\u2014 bright ceiling and bright walls.\n4.5 Directional lighting\nDirectional lighting may be used to highlight objects, reveal texture and improve the appearance of people within\nthe space. This is described by the term \"modelling\". Directional lighting of a visual task may also affect its visibility.\n4.5.1 Modelling\nModelling is the balance between diffuse and directional light. It is a valid criterion of lighting quality in virtually all\ntypes of interiors. The general appearance of an interior is enhanced when its structural features, the people and\nobjects within it are lit so that form and texture are revealed clearly and pleasingly. This occurs when the light\ncomes predominantly from one direction; the shadows so essential to good modelling are then formed without\nconfusion.\n9\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\nThe lighting should not be too directional or it will produce harsh shadows, neither should it be too diffuse or the\nmodelling effect will be lost entirely, resulting in a very dull luminous environment.\n4.5.2 Directional lighting of visual tasks\nLighting from a specific direction may reveal details within a visual task, increasing their visibility and making the\ntask easier to perform. Veiling reflections and reflected glare should be avoided, see 4.4.3.\n4.6 Colour aspects\nThe colour qualities of a near-white lamp are characterised by two attributes:\n\u2014 the colour appearance of the lamp itself,\n\u2014 its colour rendering capabilities, which affect the colour appearance of objects and persons illuminated by the\nlamp.\nThese two attributes shall be considered separately.\n4.6.1 Colour appearance\nThe \"colour appearance\" of a lamp refers to the apparent colour (chromaticity) of the light emitted. It is quantified by\nits correlated colour temperature (T ).\nCP\nColour appearance may also be described as in Table 3.\nTable 3 \u2014 Lamp colour appearance groups\nColour appearance Correlated colour temperature T\nCP\nK\nWarm below 3300 K\nIntermediate 3300 to 5300 K\nCool above 5300 K\nThe choice of colour appearance is a matter of psychology, aesthetics and of what is considered to be natural. The\nchoice will depend on illuminance level, colours of the room and furniture, surrounding climate and the application.\nIn warm climates generally a cooler light colour appearance is preferred, whereas in cold climates a warmer light\ncolour appearance is preferred.\n4.6.2 Colour rendering\nIt is important for visual performance and the feeling of comfort and well being, that colours in the environment, of\nobjects and of human skin are rendered naturally, correctly and in a way that makes people look attractive and\nhealthy.\nSafety colours shall always be recognisable as such (see also ISO 3864).\nTo provide an objective indication of the colour rendering properties of a light source the general colour rendering\nindex R has been introduced. The maximum value of R is 100. This figure decreases with decreasing colour\na a\nrendering quality.\nLamps with a colour rendering index lower than 80 should not be used in interiors where people work or stay for\nlonger periods. Exceptions may apply for some places and/or activities (e.g. high-bay lighting), but suitable\n10\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\nmeasures shall be taken to ensure lighting with higher colour rendering at fixed continually occupied work places\nand where safety colours have to be recognised.\nThe minimum value of colour rendering index for distinct types of interiors (areas), tasks or activities are given in\nclause 5.\n4.7 Flicker and stroboscopic effects\nFlicker causes distraction and may give rise to physiological effects such as headaches.\nStroboscopic effects can lead to dangerous situations by changing the perceived motion of rotating or reciprocating\nmachinery.\nLighting systems should be designed to avoid flicker and stroboscopic effects.\nNOTE This can usually be achieved for example by use of DC electrical supply for incandescent lamps, or by operating\nincandescent or discharge lamps at high frequencies (around 30 kHz).\n4.8 Maintenance factor\nThe lighting scheme should be designed with an overall maintenance factor calculated for the selected lighting\nequipment, space environment and specified maintenance schedule.\nThe recommended illuminance for each task is given as maintained illuminance. The maintenance factor depends\non the maintenance characteristics of the lamp and control gear, the luminaire, the environment and the\nmaintenance programme.\nThe designer shall:\n\u2014 state the maintenance factor and list all assumptions made in the derivation of the value,\n\u2014 specify lighting equipment suitable for the application environment,\n\u2014 prepare a comprehensive maintenance schedule to include frequency of lamp replacement, luminaire and room\ncleaning intervals and cleaning method.\n4.9 Energy considerations\nA lighting installation should meet the lighting requirements of a particular space without waste of energy. However,\nit is important not to compromise the visual aspects of a lighting installation simply to reduce energy consumption.\nThis requires the consideration of appropriate lighting systems, equipment, controls and the use of available\ndaylight.\n4.10 Daylight\nDaylight may provide all or part of the lighting for visual tasks. It varies in level and spectral composition with time\nand therefore provides variability within an interior. Daylight may create a specific modelling and luminance\ndistribution due to its nearly horizontal flow of light from side windows.\nWindows may provide visual contact with the outside world, which is preferred by most people.\nIn interiors with side windows the available daylight decreases rapidly with the distance from the window.\nSupplementary lighting is needed to ensure the required illuminance at the work place and to balance the\nluminance distribution within the room. Automatic or manual switching and/or dimming may be used to ensure\nappropriate integration between electric lighting and daylight.\nTo reduce glare from windows, screening should be provided where appropriate.\n11\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\n4.11 Lighting of workstations with Display Screen Equipment (DSE) including VDUs\n4.11.1 General\nThe lighting for the DSE work stations shall be appropriate for all tasks performed at the work station, e.g. reading\nfrom screen, printed text, writing on paper, keyboard work.\nFor these areas the lighting criteria and system shall be chosen in accordance with activity area, task type and type\nof interior from the schedule in clause 5; some countries have additional requirements.\nThe DSE and, in some circumstances, the keyboard may suffer from reflections causing disability and discomfort\nglare. It is therefore necessary to select, locate and arrange the luminaires to avoid high brightness reflections.\nThe designer shall determine the offending mounting zone and shall choose equipment and plan mounting\npositions which will cause no disturbing reflections.\n4.11.2 Luminaire luminance limits with downward flux\nThis paragraph describes luminance limits for luminaires which may be reflected in DSE screens for normal viewing\ndirections.\nTable 4 gives the limits of the average luminaire luminance at elevation angles of 65\u00b0 and above from the\ndownward vertical, radially around the luminaires for work places where display screens, which are vertical or\ninclined up to 15\u00b0 tilt angle, are used.\nNOTE For certain special places using for example sensitive screens or variable inclination the above luminance limits should\nbe applied for lower elevation angles (e.g. 55\u00b0) of the luminaire.\nTable 4 \u2014 Luminance limits of luminaires which can be reflected in the screen\nScreen classes in accordance with I II III\nISO 9241-7\nScreen quality good medium poor\nAverage luminances of luminaires \u00a3 1000 cd \u00b7 m-2 \u00a3 200 cd \u00b7 m-2\nwhich are reflected in the screen\n5 Schedule of lighting requirements\nThe lighting requirements for various rooms and activities are given in the Tables of 5.3.\n5.1 Composition of the tables\nColumn 1 lists the reference number for each interior (area), task or activity.\nColumn 2 lists those interiors (areas), tasks or activities, for which specific requirements are given.

Manufacturers publishing UGR-tables, calculated at\nspacing to height ratios other than the ratio described in CIE-publication 117, shall declare this ratio. The\ninstallation lay-out and the surface finishes shall be checked against the design assumptions.\nThe installation shall be in accordance with the design assumptions.\n6.3 Colour Rendering Index\nAuthenticated R data shall be provided for the lamps in the scheme by the manufacturer of the lamps. The lamps\na\nshall be checked against the design specifications.\nThe lamps shall be as specified in the design.\n6.4 Luminaire luminance (see also 4.11)\nThe average luminance of the luminous parts of the luminaire shall be measured and/or calculated in the C-plane\ng\nat intervals of 15\u00b0 starting at 0\u00b0 and the elevation in -angles of 65\u00b0, 75\u00b0 and 85\u00b0. Normally the manufacturer of the\nluminaire shall provide these data based on maximum (lamp/luminaire) output.\nThe values shall not exceed the limits specified in Table 4 (see also prEN 13032-1).\n31\n\n--- Page 32 ---\nEN 12464-1:2002 (E)\nAnnex A\n(informative)\nA-deviation\nA-Deviations: National deviation due to regulations, the alteration of which is for the time being outside
