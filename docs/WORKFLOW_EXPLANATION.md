# AI Standards Training System - Complete Workflow

### **Phase 1: Base Model Creation** (From PDFs in `base/` folder)

#### 📄 **Step 1: Extract ALL Content from PDFs**
```
PDF Files in base/ folder
    ↓
Extract EVERYTHING:
✅ All text content (paragraphs, sections, requirements)
✅ All tables (illuminance values, specifications, measurements)
✅ All structured data (numbers, units, standards references)
✅ All multilingual content (auto-translated to English)
```

#### 🧠 **Step 2: Create AI Base Model**
```
Extracted Content
    ↓
AI Processing:
✅ Create semantic embeddings (vector database)
✅ Train classification model (categorize content)
✅ Build searchable knowledge base
✅ Store all data for future comparisons
```

### **Phase 2: Report Comparison** (Any new PDF you upload)

#### 📊 **Step 3: Process New Report**
```
New PDF Report (any format, any language)
    ↓
Extract ALL content:
✅ All tables and text
✅ All measurements and specifications
✅ All requirements and standards
```

#### 🔍 **Step 4: Compare Against Base Model**
```
New Report Data
    ↓
AI Comparison:
✅ Find similar content in base model
✅ Identify differences and gaps
✅ Calculate similarity scores
✅ Generate compliance analysis
✅ Provide recommendations
```

## 📋 **Detailed Extraction Capabilities**

### **What Gets Extracted from PDFs:**

1. **📊 Tables:**
   - Illuminance values (lux, lx)
   - Color rendering index (CRI, Ra)
   - Glare ratings (UGR)
   - Energy requirements (W/m²)
   - Safety specifications
   - Measurement procedures

2. **📝 Text Content:**
   - All paragraphs and sections
   - Requirements and specifications
   - Standards references (EN, ISO, IEC, etc.)
   - Safety requirements
   - Environmental conditions

3. **🔢 Structured Data:**
   - Numerical values with units
   - Standards codes and references
   - Compliance criteria
   - Test procedures

4. **🌍 Multilingual Support:**
   - Auto-detect language
   - Translate to English
   - Preserve original meaning

## 🎯 **Comparison Process**

### **When You Upload a New Report:**

1. **Extract Everything** from the new PDF
2. **Compare Each Element** against the base model:
   - Illuminance requirements → Find similar in base
   - Color rendering specs → Compare with base
   - Glare control → Match against base
   - Energy efficiency → Analyze differences
   - Safety standards → Check compliance

3. **Generate Analysis:**
   - Similarity scores (0-1 scale)
   - Compliance status (Compliant/Partially/Non-compliant)
   - Key differences identified
   - Recommendations for harmonization

## 📊 **Example Output**

```
=== Comparison Results ===
New Report: "Project Lighting Specs.pdf"
Base Model: "EN 12464-1 + BREEAM Standards"

Overall Similarity: 0.847
Compliance Status: Partially Compliant

=== Category Analysis ===
Illuminance Requirements: 0.923 (Very Similar)
Color Rendering: 0.801 (Good Match)
Glare Control: 0.856 (Good Match)
Energy Efficiency: 0.789 (Needs Improvement)
Safety Standards: 0.834 (Good Match)

=== Key Differences ===
- Project requires 500 lux, base standard requires 400 lux
- Project CRI is 80, base standard requires 90
- Energy consumption exceeds base requirements by 15%

=== Recommendations ===
- Consider reducing illuminance to 400 lux for compliance
- Upgrade to CRI 90 for better color rendering
- Implement energy-saving measures to meet efficiency targets
