```python
# Some modules have good error handling:
try:
    # operation
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to process: {e}")
    return None

# Others have basic error handling:
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### **Evidence:**
```python
# Some validation exists:
if not pdf_path.exists():
    logger.error(f"PDF file not found: {pdf_path}")
    return

# But missing in other areas:
# No validation of extracted data quality
# No range checking for lighting parameters
# No format validation for input files
```
